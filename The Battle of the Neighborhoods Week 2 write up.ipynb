    "We were tasked by Company Z to locate a suitable neighborhood for a potential Mexican restaurant to thrive. This proved a daunting task, as New York is notorious for its size and complexity, so we utilized a technique covered in one of the previous labs to accomplish this. This report will serve as the answer to their question: 'Where should we open a Mexican restaurant?'."

    "Our approach to this project and analysis was fairly simple. We began by using our Foursquare API to get the coordinates of each of New York's boroughs, and from there, we proceeded to break down the boroughs into neighborhoods. Once this was accomplished, we then produced a frequency table, breaking down the frequency of specific attractions relative to each neighborhood. We then grouped all of our individual dataframes on each borough's frequency table (divided by neighborhoods) into one major dataframe. This dataframe was then focused onto the columns of 'Mexican Restaurant' and 'Neighborhood.' From there, we isolated the neighborhoods with a frequency value of 0, and used our population data to manually input each of the 30 values. Once this was achieved, we formed the 'Population'/'Neighborhood' dataframe and searched for the maximum value, leading to our conclusion.  "
